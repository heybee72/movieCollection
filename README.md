## Appendix

The code defines a simple OOP model for movies and actors. It defines two classes, Actor and Movie, and uses them to create instances of actors and movies. The Movie class has a method for adding actors to a movie, and the Actor class has a method for retrieving the age of the actor based on their birth date.

The code then uses these objects to create a collection of movies, with each movie having one or more actors. It then displays the movies and their actors using HTML markup.

Finally, the code converts the movies and actors to JSON format and to arrays. It also adds a method to the Movie class for retrieving actors ordered by descending age and additional methods for retrieving the values of each property individually.
